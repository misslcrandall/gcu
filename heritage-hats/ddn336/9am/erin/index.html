                    <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p class="p1">The name Heritage Hats was born because I wanted a name that would express my passion to learn and carry on a skill and tradition about the way of life and the traditional culture of the southwest. I moved to Phoenix from Rockford, Illinois in 1981 and became infatuated with the western lifestyle, particularly the life of the cowboy. I befriended two older gentlemen who taught me the techniques and skills of cleaning and blocking western hats for cowboys.</p> 
                        <p class="p2">As I continued to perfect my techniques and skills, I started selling western hats from my pickup truck on the weekends at rodeos and I opened my first retail store in 1983. Today, Heritage Hats is the largest hat store in Arizona with a wide variety of hats. We continue to make hats that are not only stylish but provide protection from the hot Arizona sun. We carry brands that offer a UPF of 50+ and have a 5" brim for added protection, reducing the risks of skin cancer.</p>

                            <p>We are so glad you asked! Here are some tips for both felt and straw hats:</p>
                            <p>Felt Hats:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Use a gum eraser on stains too deep to remove with a brush or towel. If sponging doesn't remove all the marks, try sanding with 100-grit paper. Move the sandpaper, very gently, in counterclockwise direction. Never press into the hat, and never press the hat into the paper.</li>
                                <li>Do not take your hat on and off your head by handling the crown. Instead, use the front and back of the brim next to the crown bend.</li>
                                <li>Do not set your hat down on its brim, which causes it to flatten and lose its shape.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Straw Hats:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Wipe with a soft cloth dipped in warm suds made with a synthetic detergent or soap.</li>
                                <li>Rinse with another cloth barely dampened with plain water and then allow to air dry.</li>
                                <li>Do not get a straw hat too wet or you could damage it.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
