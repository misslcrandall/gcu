                        <summary>Our History</summary>
                        <p>The name Heritage Hats was born because I wanted a name that would express my passion to learn and carry on a skill and tradition about the way of life and the traditional culture of the southwest. I moved to Phoenix from Rockford, Illinois in 1981 and became infatuated with the western lifestyle, particularly the life of the cowboy. I befriended two older gentlemen who taught me the techniques and skills of cleaning and blocking western hats for cowboys. Steve Speros who owned Phoenix Exclusive Hatters and George Falkedes who owned Athens Hats became my mentors and taught me how to skillfully master the techniques and skills necessary to become a restoration expert. I am proud to have inherited their original cleaning and blocking equipment from 1912.</p>

                        <summary>Why Heritage Hats?</summary>
                        <p>Because as I continued to perfect my techniques and skills, I started selling western hats from my pickup truck on the weekends at rodeos and I opened my first retail store in 1983. Today, Heritage Hats is the largest hat store in Arizona with a large variety of hats including; western felt and straws, fedora felt and straws, panamas, Australians and other popular hats and caps. Our retail space covers 3200 square feet with 2 showrooms. Our restoration workshop is in the back of the store where I continue to do cleaning and blocking on the premises. We also custom make hats; some of our most famous customers include Ronald Reagan and George Burns.</p>

                                <h3>Hat Care Tips</h3>
                                <p>At Heritage Hats, we know buying a hat is an investment. It also shows your individual style and carries memories with it throughout your life. It is often handed down through generations so we know that keeping good care of your hat is important for both the fabric of the hat and the fabric of your life. It is also used as skin cancer protection which is so important, so here are some simple care tips to keep your hats looking their finest for many years to come:</p>
                                <p>Use a soft-bristled brush to dust hats regularly. A damp terrycloth bath towel will also remove dust. Rub the surface of the hat in a circular, counterclockwise motion.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="swiper-slide">
                              <div class="felt-hats">
                                <img src="images/hatcare2.png">
                                <h3>Felt Facts</h3>
                                <p>Use a gum eraser on stains too deep to remove with a brush or towel. If sponging doesn't remove all the marks, try sanding with 100-grit paper. Move the sandpaper, very gently, in counterclockwise direction. Never press into the hat, and never press the hat into the paper.
                                Do not take your hat on and off your head by handling the crown. Instead, use the front and back of the brim next to the crown bend.
                                Do not set your hat down on its brim, which causes it to flatten and lose its shape.
                                Don't leave your hat anywhere where it gets very hot, such as an enclosed vehicle.

                            <h3>Straw Scripts</h3>
                            <p>Wipe with a soft cloth dipped in warm suds made with a synthetic detergent or soap.
                            Rinse with another cloth barely dampened with plain water and then allow to air dry.
                            Do not get a straw hat too wet or you could damage it.
