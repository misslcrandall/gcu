                        <p>At Heritage Hats, we know buying a hat is an investment.It also shows your individual style and carries memories with it throughout your life.It is often handed down through generations so we know that keeping good care of your hat is important for both the fabric of the hat and the fabric of your life. Here are some simple care tips to keep your hats looking their finest for many years to come.</p>
                    
                        <b>
                        Use a soft-bristled brush to dust hats regularly. A damp terrycloth bath towel will also remove dust. Rub the surface of the hat in a circular, counterclockwise motion.</b>

                        <h3>For Felt hats</h3>
                        <p>Use a gum eraser on stains too deep to remove with a brush or towel. If sponging doesn't remove all the marks, try sanding with 100-grit paper. Move the sandpaper, very gently, in counterclockwise direction. Never press into the hat, and never press the hat into the paper. </p>
                        <p>Do not take your hat on and off your head by handling the crown. Instead, use the front and back of the brim next to the crown bend. </p>
                        <p>Do not set your hat down on its brim, which causes it to flatten and lose its shape.</p>
                        <p>Don't leave your hat anywhere where it gets very hot, such as an enclosed vehicle.</p>

                        <h3>For Straw hats</h3>
                        <p>Wipe with a soft cloth dipped in warm suds made with a synthetic detergent or soap.</p>
                        <p>Rinse with another cloth barely dampened with plain water and then allow to air dry.</p>
                        <p>Do not get a straw hat too wet or you could damage it.</p>
